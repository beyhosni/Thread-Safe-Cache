# Thread-Safe-Cache
**Thread-Safe-Cache
Caching is technique used  to increase the performance of an application
by minimizing the number of database hits.**


**********************************************************************
_some practical steps to enhance the performance of WEB app_

**Database Optimization**

optimize your SQL queries for efficiency.
Consider database connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently

**Hibernate Performance**

refactor the Hibernate mappings and relationships to reduce the number of queries
Configure the appropriate fetching strategies (eager vs. lazy loading) to minimize unnecessary data retrieval.

**Minimize JSP Usage**

Ensure that JSPs are well-optimized and do not contain excessive business code

**Monitoring and Profiling in Production**

Continuously monitor application metrics (GRAFANA PROMOTHEUS)

**Code Review**

Conduct a code review to identify and rectify the algorithms, code .

**Application Optimizations**

optimize application-specific logic and workflows.
